# Restaurant Ratings Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on its features.

## Overview

The project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data.
- **Model Training:** Using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict ratings.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
- **Feature Analysis:** Interpreting model coefficients to understand the importance of different features.

## Dataset

For this project, we use a restaurant dataset that includes features such as:
- Restaurant Name
- Location
- Cuisine Type
- Average Cost
- Number of Reviews
- Aggregate Rating
